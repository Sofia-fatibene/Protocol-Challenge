# Initial idea

## Our flags (communicator) 
1. Have three flags with different colors:
-Black > coluored one 
-Yellow > 2 blanks
-Pink> 1 blank 
idea (if we put one flag up before the other we can when using the combanation then weather it was from the last protocole or this one)
-idea(if we count the amount of times we put u done flag )-
2. Have a series of combination of flags combined to express a certain command:
- All of them together are three coloured spaces > End of protocol (or error?)-rida 
- Yellow + Pink > 3 blanks 
- Pink + Black > two drawn 
- Black + Yellow > three drawn 

### Their flags (recivers) 
1. three flags:
-Orange  > "Repeat the entier protocol"
-Blue > "Repeat the last flag"
-Green >  "All good"  

2. Have a series of combination of flags combined to express a certain command:
-Blue + Orange > "Ready to start"
