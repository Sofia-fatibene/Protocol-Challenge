# Initial idea

## Our flags (communicator) 
1. Have three flags with different colors:
-Black > coluored one 
-Yellow > 2 blanks
-Pink> 1 blank 

2. Have a series of combination of flags combined to express a certain command:
- All of them together combos: 
  Black at the left side (from recievers view) = 4 black
  Black at the end (from recievers view) = 4 blanks
  Black in the middle = Mistake was made, redo the row
- All of them together twice > End of protocol
- Yellow + Pink > 3 blanks 
- Pink + Black > two drawn 
- Black + Yellow > three drawn 

### Their flags (recivers) 
1. three flags:
-Orange  > "Repeat the entier protocol"
-Blue > "Repeat the last row"
-Green >  "All good"  

2. Have a series of combination of flags combined to express a certain command:
-Blue + Orange > "Ready to start"
-Green + Orange > "End of protocol"

#### Communication 
-The sequence starts at the top left corner and runs through the all the tiles horizontally

##### Materials
