# Protocol-Challenge
Writing a protocol to communicate a random image to someone else across a football field using colored flags. 

## Restrictions/Rules
1) At most 3 flags can be used at each end node
2) You make your own flags
3) Flags can all be the same colour ‚öë‚öë‚öë or different colours ‚öëüè≥üö©each
4) Flags can only be raised or lowered to send a signal
5) Nodes cannot communicate using any other means (body language, sound, smell, haptics, other visuals, etc.)
6) Any number of flags can be raised or lowered at the same time
7) A maximum of (TBA) minutes is permitted to transfer an image


# Initial Idea (Not final)

## Communication
- Three flags
- More flags could be raised at once 
- One flag is black, other two are different bright colours
- When a flag is risen the action is intiated and when it's lowered the function ends

## Flags
- Black flag represent the darkened pixels on the grid
- Green flag represents two white tiles in a row
- Red flag represent one white tile

## How to read it
- The sequence starts at the top left corner and runs through the all the tiles horizontally
