# Protocol-Challenge
Writing a protocol to communicate a random image to someone else across a football field using colored flags. 


# Initial Idea (Not final)

## Communication
- Three flags
-More flags could be raised at once 
- One flag is black, other two are different bright colours
- When a flag is risen the action si intiated and when it's lowered the function ends

## Flags
- Black flag represent the darkened pixels on the grid
- Green flag represents two white tiles in a row
- Red flag represent one white tile

## How to read it
- The sequence starts at the top left corner and runs through the all the tiles horizontally
