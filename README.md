# Protocol-Challenge
Writing a protocol to communicate a random image to someone else across a football field using colored flags. 

## Restrictions/Rules
At most 3 flags can be used at each end node
You make your own flags
Flags can all be the same colour ⚑⚑⚑ or different colours ⚑🏳🚩each
Flags can only be raised or lowered to send a signal
Nodes cannot communicate using any other means (body language, sound, smell, haptics, other visuals, etc.)
Any number of flags can be raised or lowered at the same time
A maximum of (TBA) minutes is permitted to transfer an image


# Initial Idea (Not final)

## Communication
- Three flags
- More flags could be raised at once 
- One flag is black, other two are different bright colours
- When a flag is risen the action is intiated and when it's lowered the function ends

## Flags
- Black flag represent the darkened pixels on the grid
- Green flag represents two white tiles in a row
- Red flag represent one white tile

## How to read it
- The sequence starts at the top left corner and runs through the all the tiles horizontally
